# This script will create a version number from git that
# people can wrap their brains around.  If on the master
# branch, it just produces a numeric string representing
# then number of commits to master.  If on any other
# branch, it produces a string with the branch name,
# followed by a dash, followed by the number of commits
# on that branch.  The branch is followed by a dot and
# the first 7 characters of the git commit id.  If the
# current repo has changes that have not been checked
# in, there will be a .SUSPECT added.

branch=`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
version=`git log | grep '^commit' | wc -l`
